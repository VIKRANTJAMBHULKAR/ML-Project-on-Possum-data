# ML-Project-on-Possum-data

This machine learning project is centered around analyzing possum data, likely collected from various sites and comprising multiple features such as sex, age, measurements of body parts (e.g., hdlngth, totlngth), and morphological characteristics. Using Python libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas, the project aims to build predictive models to understand and potentially predict patterns in possum populations. Potential objectives include classifying possums based on demographic and physical attributes, predicting possum health or behavior based on features like age and measurements, or identifying factors influencing possum populations at different sites. By applying machine learning techniques to the possum dataset, the project aims to uncover insights into possum biology and ecology, aiding in wildlife conservation efforts and ecological research.
